# TS CHAT, A Chatting Application

# Why TS CHAT?
> TS Chat enables you to chat with others using a low end pc and moreover as it is made for low end pc's the cpu usage is very low and ram usage is under 30MB! If you use mid level cpu's like `i5-1035g1` your cpu usage will be under 5% for sure! If you don't believe then try it by yourself ðŸ˜‰...
